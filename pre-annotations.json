I warm it up in my fingers and dab a little on my eyelid and smooth it over for a nice clean base. It makes eyeshadow stand out even more; they look more pigmented, rich, and they are easy to blend and last all day. It goes on creamy but it feels matte after you apply it, which is a nice change from other primers that feel too wet at times. A little definitely goes a long way with this primer, and it covers up any coloring or veins I have on my eyelids. I find that it also helps with under eye circles, so some mornings I just dab a little of that under my eyes instead of concealer. Just don't use too much! I've not had any bad reactions with wearing it, and I tend to have sensitive eyes with wearing contacts (and also with the spring allergies).\n\nHowever...\nThe Bad: I will say that while being matte is awesome, sometimes my eyelids feel incredibly dry if I use it too frequently. It dries incredibly fast so you have to apply it quickly. I just take my middle finger and do a circular motion in the pot to help warm it on my fingertip and do one eye at a time. I also think it'd be helpful if it came in two more shades. I have light skin and use the Taffy, but I can still see the color of the primer on my lid. This isn't a huge issue since eyeshadow layers on top, but I have to careful not to blend it out too far. I think if they had one shade lighter and darker it'd make it a much more versatile range of primers.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with this primer. I'm a fan of Stila makeup and it works very wells for me.\n\nEdit-\nI've been using this primer for much longer now and have to change my opinion on some things and my rating from 4 stars to 2. I had said before that my eyelids felt really dry afterwards. Well, this product is definitely not for continuous use. I can only use it maybe once a week! Otherwise my eyelids literally feel rough, itchy, and kind of crackly. It won't bother me after wearing it all day, but if I use it 2-3 days in a row, forget it.

I have used it throughout the summer and didn't tire of it (which is rare for me), in fact I am buying another soon since I only have a few drops left.\nThe bottle is also beautiful to look at which is important since I like to leave it on my dresser.\nThe scent is a light floral with fresh notes and a delicate fruity accent, only a bit sweet unlike other florals that give you a headache. Very pretty and light, it also lingers for a few hours, but you'll need to carry this with you and use it if you want the scent throughout the whole day, or layer it with other body products from this line (like the body butter). I think Cherry Blossom would suit both a young girl or a mature woman for all occasions.\n\nUpdate:\nThis year I bought another bottle of the Cherry Blossom perfume because I ran out of my first one, but I wish I didn't because I just found out that L'Occitane tests on animals or pays for a company who tests for them, therefore they are not curelty free anymore!

Now the battery will no longer hold a charge at all.  Which is incredibly sad when you are paying so much for a product that works really well.  Honestly this company can't spend a few more cents for a decent battery that will hold up?  My induction rechargeable toothbrush has a better set up; it has lasted for 6 years and is still going strong.  Come on Clarisonic - I am not the only one who has brought this topic up.  There is an entire group of YouTube videos dedicated to detailing how to break into your products in the complicated process solely to swap out the cheap battery for a low cost - high quality battery.\nTreat your customers with a little more respect.\n===========================================\n\nMy wife likes to call this her \"little genie\".  The bristles are gentle on the skin, yet provide a thorough, deep pore cleansing.  The rotating head vibrates enough to be effecting, but not so fast that it feels like a grinding wheel and the entire package is easy to hold in your palm.  Great for control and being easy to reach all the areas of your face. The motor is powerful and does not get bogged down and the charge lasts a really long time. It has two speeds - one for extra gentle - but she rarely uses this speed.  Plus the entire package is waterproof.  To charge, just rest it in the cradle charger provided.\n\nMy wife like to use her preferred cleanser (not a bar of soap). Her recommendation is to keep the brush head clean and dry when not in use.  In other words, don't use it, put it down and just walk away.  Keep the head clean and make sure it dries really well between use.  She sets hers bristle down on a folded sheet of paper towel.  As others have stated, soak it in hydrogen peroxide every few weeks.\n\nKind of pricey, but well made and certainly worth it.\n\nCheers!"}, "predictions": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}, {"data": {"text": "I now own 3 of these brushes: 1 in my bathroom 2nd in my gym bag and 3rd in my suitcase."}, "predictions": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}, {"data": {"text": "It was broken up into lots of tiny pieces when opened."}, "predictions": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}, {"data": {"text": "i have used this product before many times but this time around the Moroccan oil was different.

I have a light/medium skin tone and this looked very unnatural/whited-out on me. The formula is also a little greasier than I would normally like in a lip balm, and I'd love to see it with a bit more wax, heavier oils, or even some powder fillers to give it a little more thickness and longevity and a more even application (since mineral sunscreens need to be on in a thick and even layer to protect, and I can see just how unevenly it's applying since it's so light on me). I have taken to applying this over a sheer matte pink-toned lip color to balance some of the whiteness out.

You apply it to your clean  face and neck avoiding the eye area.  It dries in 5 to 10 minutes.  You then remove it using warm water.\n\n\"I tried this product before my morning shower.

It's lightweight and narrow, unlike some of the bulky straighteners I've owned in the past. This is a plus as it takes up less counter space and isn't an eyesore.\n\nThere is one button that controls on/off and the temperature of the device. Holding down the button turns it on/off, while double clicking allows for temperature control. Above the button there is a series of lights that change depending on the temperature and indicate that the straighter is heating vs ready to use. While, as far as I can tell, this type of control set-up does work, the different temperatures are not noted on the device. I use the same temp every time, so this doesn't affect me as much, but, if you might need to adjust the heat, you'll have to check the instructions pamphlet for temp ranges.\n\nI have admittedly thin hair, but it is naturally curly. I had no problem straightening the majority with only one pass, but some of the more finicky bits, like my bedhead bangs, took a bit more finesse.\n\nAs a plus, this straightener did come with two hair clips to divide and twist up hair when straightening.

It is thick and creamy and a delightful green color.  The cream smears around on the skin nicely and when adding a little bit of water to it, it does foam up some, but is not really sudsy like some soaps can be.  It does make skin soft at first, but then I feel as if the skin is too stripped.  The time that I am testing this in is a time of humidity and more oiliness and this cleanser is stripping my skin already- in winter, I am thinking it will be way too much for me to use.  I have normal to dry skin.\n\nI have had my daughter test it.  She said it was nice at first but felt it stripped her skin a bit too much.\n\nIn both cases, the skin surface felt smooth, although dry and tight.\n\nI have not had the men try it yet- they don't like to try new products. It is hard to pin them down.\n\nTHE WORST PART- ITCHING\nThe worst part about this cleanser is that it made our skin itch a bit.  Perhaps it was from drying it out so much or maybe the sodium laureth sulfate it contains, but it just makes the skin feel uncomfortable.  No matter how much lotion I apply, it does not seem to soothe this feeling entirely.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nGreat sized bottle, lovely texture and green color, this soap seemed promising.  Creamy and easy to use without being overly foamy, I found the fragrance to be a bit overwhelming and it left our skin stripped and a bit itchy and uncomfortable and tight.\n\nI have given this one star.  If you have very oily skin and perhaps don't mind it being a strong cleanser, then perhaps you would like it.

It is thick and creamy and a delightful green color.  The cream smears around on the skin nicely and when adding a little bit of water to it, it does foam up some, but is not really sudsy like some soaps can be.  It does make skin soft at first, but then I feel as if the skin is too stripped.  The time that I am testing this in is a time of humidity and more oiliness and this cleanser is stripping my skin already- in winter, I am thinking it will be way too much for me to use.  I have normal to dry skin.\n\nI have had my daughter test it.  She said it was nice at first but felt it stripped her skin a bit too much.\n\nIn both cases, the skin surface felt smooth, although dry and tight.\n\nI have not had the men try it yet- they don't like to try new products. It is hard to pin them down.\n\nTHE WORST PART- ITCHING\nThe worst part about this cleanser is that it made our skin itch a bit.  Perhaps it was from drying it out so much or maybe the sodium laureth sulfate it contains, but it just makes the skin feel uncomfortable.  No matter how much lotion I apply, it does not seem to soothe this feeling entirely.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nGreat sized bottle, lovely texture and green color, this soap seemed promising.  Creamy and easy to use without being overly foamy, I found the fragrance to be a bit overwhelming and it left our skin stripped and a bit itchy and uncomfortable and tight.\n\nI have given this one star.  If you have very oily skin and perhaps don't mind it being a strong cleanser, then perhaps you would like it.  For us, it really is rough on our skin and it just leaves us too uncomfortable to rate it higher than that."}, "predictions": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}, {"data": {"text": "   !       .       .\n     .  \"      ."}, "predictions": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}, {"data": {"text": "Product as descripted"}, "predictions": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}, {"data": {"text": "It was received completely intact.

I have been working out a lot this year and counting calories, and I have lost more than 30 pounds.  I've been trying different anti-cellulite products to get a little extra help, appearance-wise.  I've been using this one for a few weeks now.\n\nIt is hard to tell if this is working.  I know that 95% of reducing cellulite is diet and exercise, so I have seen some improvement simply because of those factors.  I don't necessarily think any of it is due to this product in particular.  (I am just using this on the outer thighs and rear end, twice per day.  It is probably going to last about six weeks at the rate I am going, which is a reasonable period of time for a product of this size)  I am not noticing much change at all.  (In fairness, with other products, I do occasionally feel like I see a difference.)\n\nThe other thing is, I really don't like the oil format.  It doesn't absorb well into the skin at all and leaves a sheen of oil over where I've applied it, as well as on my hands.  There are some other body oils I use on occasion that don't have this problem.  But I really don't like the greasy feeling I get after I apply this.  (I ordered straight from Nuxe so I know I have a legitimate bottle of product.  The pump works well and it is plastic, which is nice -- I don't care for body care products in glass bottles, which can break very easily in *my* bathroom.)  Also, you do have to massage this in for a long time -- that's in the instructions on the package.  So this may not be for impatient people!\n\nIt is not causing any irritation or sensitivity-type reactions, so that's good.  I don't notice a strong smell or really any scent at all.  (I have constantly clogged sinuses, though, so maybe I am not the best judge...)\n\nPlease note this has some tree nut and sesame-derived ingredients, so avoid if you have those allergies.  You can see the full ingredients list if you zoom in on the product images.\n\nIn the end, you will get the most results from diet and exercise.  For supplementary purposes, I find massage with a cellulite massager and coffee scrub in the shower on the affected areas, plus using a body cream containing retinol twice a day to be most effective.

It smells great, like all their products, and moisturizes like a dream!  The skin under my eyes has never ever felt SO SMOOTH and wrinkle free.

It is very gentle and felt like nothing at all, so I wore this one under makeup during the day. It soaks in super fast and doesn't feel greasy, but lasts for hours.

Not only to you need the brush to perform well, but be durable and stand up to cleaning.  Let's see how the Japonesque Kumadori Countour/Highlight Brush measures up.\n\nWHAT IS THIS BRUSH LIKE?\nThis brush is about 6 1/2\" long with the handle being 5\" and the brush head 1 1/2\" long.  The brush head is about 1 3/8\" wide at its widest point.  The shape of the brush is a teardrop shape.  The bristles are natural and they are not at all dense in the way they are packed.  I would put this more in the fluffy category and not dense.\n\nThe handle is tapered, but the base seems to be a rubbery base underneath.  A rim of that material is visible up near the base of the brush head.  The rest of the handle is wrapped with a natural piece of what resembles thin wicker.  I am not sure what the actual name of it is.  It is wrapped and glued down with the end tucked up under at the top.  It simply ends at the tip of the handle and is not tucked down.  The surface texture of the wrapped handle makes it easy to hold and manipulate in your hand, although in certain positions it can feel rough.\n\nHOW DOES THIS BRUSH PERFORM?\nAs for performance, this brush does not do too well picking up product from a pan unless the pan of makeup is very very soft and easily picked up.  It does not disperse the product as equally on the skin as I would like.  I have tried this with blush, bronzer and highlighter, but I find that it seems to work best with Guerlain Meteorites.\n\nThat is not necessarily a bad thing as Guerlain Meteorites are little balls of product which are in different colors.  It is hard to find a brush which applies them well.  They act more as a highlight or finishing powder in a very subtle manner.\n\nThis brush would also work decently with mineral makeup.  The tip makes it get into smaller spaces of the face like around the nose and inner eyes, but is broad enough to use on the rest of the face and under the chin.\n\nI did not find that the bristles were dense or sturdy enough to pick up sufficient product to apply to the skin evenly from pans of color such as contour or highlight.\n\nI tend to get better results from brushes in that same shape but much higher density than this one is.\n\nWHAT I DO NOT LIKE ABOUT THIS BRUSH\nMy biggest problem with this brush is that it is not going to be easy to clean.  Brushes are meant to be used and that means they will get dirty.  Sometimes handles will also get dirty.  In the case of this brush, the handle being wrapped by the wicker like pieces, I don't see this brush being easy to clean.  The bristles being wet only is possible, but any moisture at all on this handle is bound to make it come apart eventually.\n\nI imagine if you were to coat the handle with something that would withstand moisture, you could probably still use this brush and it would be more practical.  That way the handle would not unwrap with constant cleaning and you could still enjoy the brush.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nIf used for application of light powdery highlights or contour that is not packed hard in a pan, or sphere powders like Guerlain Meteorites, this brush would be good.  For use where you want to deposit color more evenly from pans of product, it is not the best brush. The composition of the handle makes it not practical to clean as if the handle becomes wet over time, the handle will probably come apart.  It you are a brush collector and love unusual brushes, and the practicality of this does not matter to you, then you might still love this brush.  If you are a practical person who uses their brushes a lot and likes to keep them clean all of the time, this might not be the brush for you.\n\nI have rated this two stars because I feel that it just isn't practical for makeup use that leads to lots of cleaning for that price."}, "predictions": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}, {"data": {"text": "Helps with setting curls."}, "predictions": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}, {"data": {"text": "Helps with setting curls."}, "predictions": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}, {"data": {"text": "Want to rate 5 stars but I HATE the cap/pump! the pump unscrewed all the time and unscrewed in my cosmetic bag when i was traveling and spilled all over the bag. plus the cap cracked after one use.

It was working great for the first few days and then out of no where my skin reacted awfully. It made my eczema flare up and with a vengeance. I was itching from head to toe. Since stopping it my skin has calmed down and is back to everyday itchies (ie hands and lower legs). Tried their shamp/cond & bar soap products as well thinking the Tea Tree Oil line would be my cure-all for skin conditions and overall I'm thoroughly disappointed.\n\n[INITIAL REVIEW]: Wow I love this stuff! It's a great moisturizer! I don't think I'll use it as a leave in conditioner because I have long, fine hair and any product added usually just weighs my hair down & makes it feel greasy/heavy. So only reviewing as a skin moisturizer and dang this stuff is awesome! Wish I could underline lol! Awesome because of the smell (I know I'm going to lose a few people here, but I actually like the kind of minty, citronella candle smell), it absorbs quickly and thoroughly, which is definitely something that is hard to find. Even some lotions that say they absorb with no greasy feeling don't cut it and this stuff does! It seems to be helping my eczema! It's almost cleared up my arms and has nearly completely cleared up my hands including some hard, scaly patches that almost look like psoriasis, though I've never been diagnosed with that skin condition. I've used it all over my body and so far my only (very mild) complaint is, it made the skin of my face & neck break out so I will stick to Clinique products on my face, but everywhere else get's a nice, soothing coating of PM Tea Tree Oil Moisturizer. Next time I'm buying industrial size! It's working wonders for the cracks on the heels of my feet. Also just a FYI a little goes a loooong way!

By now you know that I am not only a licensed Hair stylist and Makeup Artist to some of the biggest names, but I am one of the most trusted on product knowledge. You also know that I am not paid for endorsements and I'm unbiased. Moroccan Oil was exciting when it first launched at our industry trade show, Premiere, in Orlando, Fl. They had demo's on the spot, and handed out mini sample bottles to everyone with their grubby little hands out, mine included. As I researched this product and its ingredients a little deeper, I discovered that it is only a subtle, temporary fix for giving a little smoothing effect to the hair. There is no long term benefits from using this product. Don't waste your money. Yes, it smells nice, but it's not what it claims to be. No, I'm not hating on Moroccan Oil. There is nothing wrong with using it if you are just looking for a subtle and temporary fix and don't mind spending the money. You could get better results with pure organic coconut oil (used in small amounts). Now that I've told you the truth about this product, I will be honest and say I love their hairsprays and glimmer shine spray. You'll have to read those reviews there. If you want an alternative to this oil, Orofluido is much better, smells better and has more lasting results. Be sure to read my reviews before purchasing any hair product.

It's juicy, and strong.\n\n  After a few minutes, Artisan evens out with a pleasing floral note (orange blossoms, as I'm told), and you catch hints of aromatic wood and sweet musk.

I needed a clear lip product to apply before going to bed because I like the feeling of moisturized lips in the morning. I didn't really expect anything from this little tube, but I was blown away. The gloss isn't sticky or shimmery, it's just enough to hydrate your lips. I wear it in the morning, and again at night time, and I haven't had to exfoliate my lips since I started using this product. My lips feel plump and smooth all day long. My lipsticks have never looked better! It's the only lip product I have actually fully used up, this being my third tube.

I purchased my Mia 2 from Herbergers when I had stopped in to purchase more Clinique face wash.  I had been using Clinique face wash for over a year and for some reason it just wasn't working anymore.  The girl at the counter told me about Mia 2 and being a 40 yr old with a break-out that wouldn't go away, I decided to spend the money and give it a shot.  The girl had a couple coupons that brought the price down and made me feel slightly better about spending the money on it.\n\nI've had problems with breakouts for the past 10-12 yrs and have tried countless different face washes without success until the Clinique. Then that stopped working. This latest breakout was along my jawline.  I have a problem with oily skin all month long but its especially bad during my cycle. I've been using the Mia 2 for a little over 2 weeks now and initially I had little extra breakout spots, which I expected as the extra junk rose to the surface. Nothing big.  The breakouts along my jawline, I THINK, are finally starting to heal. Is it clearing up because of the Mia 2 or the cleanser?  Don't know that.  I can tell that the pores on my nose and chin are smaller and I'm sure that's because of the Mia 2.  Happy about that.  We'll see what happens with my next cycle.\n\nI also used this on my 9 yr old who has a problem with white heads on her nose and blackheads on her chin.  After only a few uses, we could already see a difference in her skin.  So for that, we both feel it's worth it.\n\nWhat I don't like about the Mia 2:\nI don't like the timed shut off.  I don't like that I only get one minute to wash my face and I don't see the point in the little beep that tells me to switch to a different spot on my face.  I get that it's so I can get the most out of that one minute but if it didn't have that one minute time in the first place they wouldn't need the stupid  beep.  Most days, I feel I need more than a minute so I'm hitting the button to use up two one minute cycles.  What if I'm having a particularly bad day and feel I need to wash extra or have an extra large face?  Or, in my case, I need to wash my jaw line and part of my neck so that's not included in the spots they tell you to wash for a certain amount of time and therefore I run out of time when washing my face and the thing shuts off on me.  Frustrating.\n\nThe second speed is pointless.  I honestly cannot tell any difference between the first and the second speed but I still hit the button twice. I guess it's psychological. It must be going faster if I'm hitting the button twice, right?!\n\nThe battery life totally SUCKS!  The instructions say that you should charge it for 24 hrs before the initial use.  Like most battery opperated items you buy, that's normal.  So then I read that I can expect 24 minutes of use out of a full charge.  Serious?!  That's it?!  So if I'm using two one minute charges morning and night (not including if I use it on my daughter), that's only going to give me 6 days of use!  What a crock!  To top that off is the charging time.  It's almost as bad as the initial charge.  I went to use it one night and it was dead.  So, I popped it on the charger before I went to bed, not knowing how long it would take to charge, I figured it would be ready for me to use the next morning.  Nope, it was still charging when I got up! Came home from work and it was STILL charging!  Pulled out my instruction manual to see what it said about charge time and I read that it takes 18 HOURS for additional charges!  Again...SERIOUS?!  Isn't there a rapid charger or something?!  Depending on when I put it on the charger, that's like 2-3 face washings I have to miss for a charging.  I just have a hard time believing that for the amount of money this thing costs they wouldn't put better battery in this thing or give you a better charger!\n\nSo those are my thougts on it.  I'm fairly satisfied with the results and won't be returning it but had I known ahead of time the things I know now, I don't know if I would have spent the money on it.  I'm certainly not rich and struggled with the decision to buy it because of the cost.  I will update again in a month or so to let you know how things are going.\n\nUpdate 12/1/2013...so after using for a couple months but before my 90 days was up, I just wasn't seeing the results I wanted to see in my breakouts and decided this was too much money to spend on something that was going to sit in my drawer and not work so I contacted Clarisonic to start the return process.  To Clarisonics credit, they didn't question my return or give me any trouble. I had to email them a copy of my receipt and within two days they emailed me a UPS shipping label to return the product.

That lightness makes it easy to smooth on the face.  The downside to that: it's so light that it doesn't impart much moisture at all.  This would be great for someone who doesn't have particularly dry skin, but for those of us who need a big dose of moisture, this doesn't work for that.  For those who benefit from light moisturization, be prepared for how this product gives you that: in my experience, after it's smoothed on, it leaves a lightly tacky, even greasy feel to the skin.\n\nThe scent has gotten a lot of mentions in reviews, and there is a reason for that.  I thought it would be fine for me even though I'm very sensitive to strong aromas because \"parfum/fragrance\" is the last item on the ingredient list.  Initially, it seems to have a lovely, light rose scent.  However, that scent doesn't dissipate at all - it just sits there on your face, and for me, it became cloying and eventually overwhelming.  By the time I'd had it on for about a half hour, I'd begun to develop a headache and had to wash it off.  (Side note: it didn't come off easily at all with just water; this is the kind of product that requires some kind of cleanser to totally remove.)\n\nThe packaging is nice, in terms of the inside of the box having diagrams and instructions for application of the product, and the jar is quite pretty with a useful mirror serving as the top of the lid.  The downside here, though, is that this obviously requires you to dip your fingers into the product in order to then apply it to your face; as such, even with clean hands, eventually bacteria could start to be a concern, so I would have preferred if the cream had come in a pump-form.\n\nThe aspects of the product that don't have \"cons\" - it's paraben free, and even though my skin is highly sensitive, I didn't experience any irritation when I put this on my face.  (However, it is worth noting again that I could only tolerate having it on my skin for a half hour because of the fragrance.)\n\nIt's been so difficult - actually it's been impossible, thus far - for me to find a moisturizer/cream that won't irritate my sensitive skin and won't make my extreme sensitivity to fragrance come into play.  This product will likely work for people who don't have to deal with those things and don't require a product that delivers a lot of moisture.  For all of those like me who are on a quest for an effective, non-irritating, non-aggravating moisturizer, the search continues."}, "predictions": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}, {"data": {"text": "************** I am downgrading this hairspray to two stars from five. Why? Because after a week and less than 1/4 of the can used, the entire spray nozzle has failed. It's not clogged or blocked. It has simply stopped working. This happened as I was in the middle of preparing for a formal wedding at 5pm on a Saturday night at a country resort in the middle of nowhere. I couldn't run out and buy a new can of hair spray and I had to borrow some from the bride!!! Never again.\n\n***************** Original Review below **************************************************\nI use hair spray every single day and I have been trying to find a single good brand that does the job off my current two brands. I have settled on Suave for the days when I am outside with the horses in the wind, dust and humidity simply because it is inexpensive and my hair stays put. But the trade off is I can't run a brush through my hair after spraying it and it can get dry in the summer. My second option has been Fekkai brand which is excellent, smells pretty, and holds well, yet feels soft & I can brush my hair and it still looks great. But....Fekkai is outrageously overpriced and hard to justify & the nozzles don't always work.\n\nThis CHI Keratin has a mild and not unpleasant scent, sprays out in a wide, fine mist and doesn't feel sticky. My hair feels soft and looks nice - the same way it does with the Fekkai and I can brush it for touch ups. If I use a bit more than when I use the Suave, I get a similar strong hold in a wind outside and humidity. On a normal day or if I am going to be inside only, a light spritz of the CHI is all I need.

I have found that round brushing when doing a blow out doesn't work for my very long curly hair. I much prefer to use the straightening pik or comb attachment with a hair dryer and then flat iron. There are not very many hair dryers like that on the market except ones specifically geared towards my demographic (if you know what I mean). So, this hair dryer fit the bill. When I received the package I initially tested it out and the first thing I noticed was the awesome comb attachment. It is made of durable plastic and the pik's teeth are thick and seem to be well constructed. I don't think you'll have a problem with comb breaking at all. Now as for the hair dryer itself, it is a fail. The hair dryer is a very pretty red color and is relatively quiet but its very awkward to hold in your hands for a long period of time. It felt like my hands were sliding off of the handle, not to mention the control buttons are right on the area where you would hold the dryer - definitely annoying. The hair dryer also doesn't seem to get very hot. I need major heat and this was just so-so. I had an Andis dryer before and while my Andis is only 1875 watts it seemed to get my hair much more straighter. I have now purchased the Allure 2200 Watt Hair Dryer sold here on amazon http://www.amazon.com/Allure-2200w-Professional-Ionic-Ceramic/dp/B00SKQFT4I and it has worked surprisingly well for me.

I never bought any because of the price, and, I am not all that self conscious about my balding anyway.  However when a good friend of mine got some for his thinning hair I was so impressed by how it good it looked that I begged him to let me use it just once.  The color wasn't exactly right but that didn't matter since it was only a test... Unfortunately I have to say that even though it worked very well on my friends hair that is only thinning, it was a total bomb for me who has a real beach head coming in on the top.  Quite simply, one has to pay very close attention to the description of how this stuff says it works.  It clearly states that it needs or works by bonding with your existing hair.  If you have either no, or hardly any existing hair, it just comes out looking like a lot of very homely fuzzy stuff.  I tried it all over the top of my head and it simply stuck to it, and then ended up looking like some kind of very short, fuzzy, sparsely covered type dog hair.  Very ugly and fake looking and not at all worth the price or the bother for sure....\n\nAs for how it worked for my friend I have nothing but praise.  It was amazing the way it blended in and stuck to what thinning hair he had and combed out looking completely natural.  If you really want to see how this stuff looks in use, type the name of it into google and go to videos.  There are several online that depict a true demonstration of how good this stuff works on thinning hair.  Even on very thinning hair.  But not a one I found showed someone with a real Dr. Phil look, or even just a completely bare bald spot.  Without some minimal hair to cling to you are like me, fresh out of luck and too late.  If my hair was only thinning I would consider the hefty price of this worth it I believe.  Just remember for the truly bald, its a bust...\n\nIn conclusion, I decided to take off one star on the rating simply because I feel that despite this working very well on thinning hair, I believe that the description should more forcefully state that its not for bald heads. I don't think it does clearly enough to satisfy me. Not even the manufacturers web site that has a more detailed description says anything about bald heads.  Personally I feel that the majority of the negative reviews of it comes from those that are too far ahead with hair loss and just came out with a big fail on their part.  It was with me for sure.  Highly recommended only  for those with thinning hair that this stuff can cling too, and that feel hiding it well is worth the price... : )"}, "predictions": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}, {"data": {"text": "AFTER USING THIS MY SKIN FEELS SO SKIN.

Being a veteran weeaboo, the first safety razor I tried was some legit Japanese stuff (forgot the brand, sorry) paired with Feather blades.  I have delicate, sensitive little girl's skin marred with big red-black thick quasi-Lovecraftian double-sprouting beard hairs; surely some sort of punishment for past-life atrocities.  After using the Japanese blades, my face was left as bloody as a Tarantino movie set in the after-hours.  I thought I'd get the hang of it with practice.  I didn't, and ended up giving up and going back to selling my internal organs in order to afford Mach 3 razors.\n\nSince moving to Germany, my second attempt was this Merkur 23C, with its weird blade wings thingie.  I used Astra blades because I found an affordable 100-pack at Amazon.de.  The combo works well enough.  The only thing I can't achieve with it is the mythical \"one-stroke shaving\" which wet shaving forums on the Internet preach of.  Like, apparently you're supposed to caress your face with a single Meistestroke with, while following the grain, would close-shave all your beard hairs in one go even as they clean the foam elegantly like an enlightened Zen swordsmonk sweeping a rock garden, leaving nary a shade behind. If stubble is  left at all, it means you suck, but you're allowed to lather up again and draw a second, shameful stroke at a right angle to the grain.  If even then there are still hairs left, you can do a final, desperate stroke against the grain, and then presumably live-stream your seppuku for TheShaveDen elders.\n\nNo matter how I try it, after three strokes not even Jesus would be generous enough to call my face anywhere near \"shaved\".  My shaving process end up looking more like Jackson Pollock's \"Autumn Rhythm\", with dozens of strokes going upwards, downwards, diagonalwards, irregularly around facial features, in Golden Ratio spirals etc.  Despite all this abuse, this razor does not leave me burned or bleeding at all, which I take to be quite the achievement.  It doesn't achieve a close shave either, but then again neither does Mach 3, which costs ten gazillion dollars in the long-term and also makes me bleed a whole lot.\n\nOne day I'll save big bucks, go to some laser hair removal shop of renown, burn every. single. strand of beard hair back to the pits of Hell where they came from, and then post it on Art of Manliness to troll masculinity-worshippers.

I bought this curling iron for my wife, after reading online reviews.  She LOVED this curling iron.  She liked that it heated up fast, opened and closed well, gripped her hair when she wanted it to, and let go when it was supposed to.\n\nI couldn't say exactly when it went from \"love\" to less than that.  But it started probably around the two year mark, after being used on average, about once per week.  It started to not heat up really well, and I think that there had been a flaw of some kind in the power cord, at the point where the cord attaches to the swivel connection on the iron.  There was no visible problem, anywhere on the cord.  It eventually got to the point where it didn't heat at all.  That was probably in this last year, so it was a good 2-3 years old, I would say.\n\nSo this last winter, about 2/2014, I took the thing apart, and couldn't find a thing wrong.  I put it back together and kind of told my wife that it was her imagination--I don't know, I think I was just too busy at the time to be bothered.  Then when I saw her a few weeks later using another old curling iron, and I asked her why she wasn't using the her favorite, and she said it just doesn't work anymore.  So I figured maybe she wasn't making it up :)\n\nI took it apart again, and put an ohm meter on the cord part, and it was not good.  I figured it unlikely that it was in the actual cord.  So I started to cut into the thick part of the cord where it had a reinforced curve in it, and was able to get down to where I found that there must have been a break there.  I cut that part of the cord out, soldered the cord onto the connectors that had been inside that molded reinforced curve, and put all of it back together with epoxy as something of a new homemade connection to reinforce it, and she was off and running again.\n\nThen in just the last few months, probably when the curling iron was about 3 1/2 years old, my wife started complaining that the curling iron was not gripping her hair well enough, and was slipping, and also that it was making a squeaking sound whenever she opened and closed the pincers--don't know if that's the right term.  I am also not sure I understand another comment that she made, though, that she has trouble getting her hair out of it when she finds it is slipping.\n\nAnyway, all of that doesn't matter.  I just looked at the spring area and could see that up underneath where the spring is, the point that contacts the pincer just below the thumb knob, there is a tiny roller that helps the spring to slide quietly back and forth, that was off center, and it also wasn't rolling anymore.  It was mostly sliding.  So I adjusted it to the side a little, and liberally sprayed some dry lubricant on it.  The action works better, and it doesn't make any noise, so we will have to wait until she uses it again to see if it works.\n\nSo as of today 6/16/2014, the iron is still going after approximately 200+ uses, albeit with some required tweaking to keep it out of the garbage.  I would like to believe that the power cord issue that we had was a rare defect, and that most people never run into that.  I'm thinking that most people could use this iron over 200 times and probably just be starting to have a squeaky spring issue, and that's about it.  If I were to have to start this product search again, I would definitely take a chance again on this iron, and hope that we didn't get the cord defect in that reinforced bend near the swivel.\n\nFor the money, and the use that we've had with this, I think it's a great deal.  I actually just realized that we probably have used it many more than 200 times, as we have four girls aged 12 and under as well, but they generally don't get their hair curled, although on some special occasions, several of them do.\n\nDetails on my star rating:\nWhy did I ding this by one star?

Also, I saw the inside of it when I was working on it, and although the parts were adequate, I would be cheating a curling iron with better quality parts that deserved the five stars, if I were to give this one five.\n\nAs I've said in other reviews that I've written, to me, either four or five stars is a \"buy with confidence\" in my book.  I wouldn't buy anything again with 1-2 stars on my scale, and a middle-of-the-road three star review by me would be \"your mileage may vary\" and would be a 50/50 shot."}, "predictions": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}, {"data": {"text": "Purchased 6/2010, reviewed 6/2014:\n\nWell, better late than never.  I bought this curling iron for my wife, after reading online reviews.  She LOVED this curling iron.  She liked that it heated up fast, opened and closed well, gripped her hair when she wanted it to, and let go when it was supposed to.\n\nI couldn't say exactly when it went from \"love\" to less than that.  But it started probably around the two year mark, after being used on average, about once per week.  It started to not heat up really well, and I think that there had been a flaw of some kind in the power cord, at the point where the cord attaches to the swivel connection on the iron.  There was no visible problem, anywhere on the cord.  It eventually got to the point where it didn't heat at all.  That was probably in this last year, so it was a good 2-3 years old, I would say.\n\nSo this last winter, about 2/2014, I took the thing apart, and couldn't find a thing wrong.  I put it back together and kind of told my wife that it was her imagination--I don't know, I think I was just too busy at the time to be bothered.  Then when I saw her a few weeks later using another old curling iron, and I asked her why she wasn't using the her favorite, and she said it just doesn't work anymore.

I really don't like having greasy hair.\n\nIm really glad I got to try this stuff. While it goes on like a regular styling cream, once it dries it actually makes your hair softer than before, and yet somehow stays in place. Basically, if you have thick unmanageable hair, this stuff will somehow change your hair on a molecular level to the normal hair of a person that dated in high school.\n\nIt smells fine, but not something you normally associate with hair. Sort of like standing between a hair salon and an Italian restaurant, in terms of scent. I assume that's due to the Rosemary.\n\nSo, given that this stuff is so great, why four stars instead of five? Because its overpriced. Jack Black recently lowered the amount of product, but kept the price the same. The tube you get is far less than half full. Unless they were losing money before, they are price gouging now.  You used to get about 18% more in a bottle than you do now. Unlike a pomade, youll go through a bottle of this fairly quickly with daily use, so I think $15 is a bit high.

I honestly didn't drop it hard or far.....about 2 feet from the carpet at most. Well the inside of the BD broke into a gazillion plastic pieces and stopped working. I don't know if the plastic part weakened from the prolonged heat exposure,or what exactly happened. All I know is that it definitely should not have broken that easily. I have dropped BD's from much higher and on tile and it still held up. Unfortunately the dryer was a gift and I didn't have a receipt or I would have contacted the company and explained the situation. I don't know how they would have handled it,so I can't comment about the customer service.
